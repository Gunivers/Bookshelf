# 🔌Installation

Go to the [Glib Manager](http://glib.gunivers.net) website to select the version and the modules you want to use. You can check the modules' content in the [Documentation](https://glib-core.readthedocs.io).

Once you download the ZIP file, simply put it into you world's "datapacks" folder and, in-game, execute the `/reload` command.

⚠️ **Be sure that "cheats" are enabled**. Or, if you are on a server, be sure that `enable-command-block` is set on `true` in you `server.properties` file.

⚠️ **Some modules can be heavy**. Like the `glib.block` or `glib.item` that contain search trees. If you download them, the reload can take some time. If you edit the datapack, be sure to compress it in a zip file before uploading it somewhere. In the other cases, the search trees will slow down the upload due to thousands of little files.
