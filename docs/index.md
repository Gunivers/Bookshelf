## 🔥 Motivation

As developers, we recognize the importance of using libraries to save time and avoid reinventing the wheel. Unfortunately, we've noticed that mapmakers within the Minecraft community are often unfamiliar with this concept.

That's why we started this project, to introduce a variety of reusable tools and try to convice mapmakers to embrace the use of libraries.

While we strive to keep these modules as much optimized and accurate as possible, our main goal is to offer a wide range of features and provide tools that are both easy to use and install. Therefore, we will always prioritize accessibility above everything else.
