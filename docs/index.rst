Glib-Core

The Gunivers-libs is a series of tool datapacks, that group together all
the functions and systems that can be used in your maps, to simplify
your task. The central element of which is the "Glib-Core" datapack.
They allow to abstract some complex algorithms, i.e. to hide their
complexity by simply providing the procedure to follow to use them. This
abstraction also allows you not to have to worry about updating these
functions, you just have to update the whole datapack in your map, and
it will then use the most recent functions, without having to change
anything in your code.

Thus, you will find fundamental functions such as trigonometry functions (sin, cos, tan ...) as well as practical functions such as :
- an ID system for entities
- a block <-> score conversion system to detect which block is
targeted
- a pathfinding system
- or a system allowing the management of vectors to give very
customized trajectories to your entities, which can be deflected by the
wind, bounce on blocks etc...
