## ðŸ”§ Functions

You can find below all functions available in this module.

### Aimed block

```{function} #bs.view:at_aimed_block {run:<command>,with:{}}

Run a command at the aligned coordinates of the block an entity is aiming at.

:Inputs:
  **Execution `as <entities>`**: Entity whose eyes determine the vision origin.

  **Function macro**:
  :::{treeview}
  - {nbt}`compound` Arguments
    - {nbt}`string` **run**: Command to run at the targeted block position.
    - {nbt}`compound` **with**: Optional settings (see advanced usage below).
  :::
```

*Change the block you are looking at:*

```mcfunction
# Once (will run if you are targeting a block)
function #bs.view:at_aimed_block {run:"setblock ~ ~ ~ minecraft:sponge",with:{}}
```

```{admonition} Advanced usage
:class: dropdown

This system is a simplified, specific use case of the `#bs.raycast:run` function. It internally relies on it, allowing you to read its output and providing the flexibility to alter its behavior by modifying its input. [Learn more here](raycast.md)

```{admonition} Performance tip
:class: tip

In Minecraft, predicates can check if a player is looking at an entity. If you only need a simple player specific check, you should consider using the [Looked entity](#looked-entity) functions.

```

```{admonition} Avoid the advancement
:class: important

This function simulates block placement but is discouraged for use with the `placed_block` advancement due to potential differences in precision compared to Minecraft. Rapid mouse movements during the same tick may also result in the wrong block being targeted.

  - {nbt}`compound` Arguments
    - {nbt}`number` **angle**: Angle that represents the field of view. This is the angle of the cone's aperture, based on the world coordinates and not the fov option.
  :::
```

*Check whether the position 0 5 0 is in your field of view::*

```mcfunction
# Once
execute as @s positioned 0 5 0 run function #bs.view:in_view_ata {angle:90}
