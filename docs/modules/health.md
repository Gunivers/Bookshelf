```{admonition} About NBTs
:class: warning

When using the module, you cannot rely on NBTs to get health information. Use the `get_health` and `get_max_health` functions instead. This is because NBTs may not consistently reflect actual values. This choice was made to enhance performance, reliability, and to work around some limitations.
