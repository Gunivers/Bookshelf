```{admonition} Virtual block format
:class: info

To manipulate blocks and their states, Bookshelf utilizes a [virtual block format](#get) stored in the block output. It's crucial not to update it manually; instead, utilize the helper functions provided in the library.

### Manage type

:::::{tab-set}
::::{tab-item} Replace

```{function} #bs.block:replace_type {type:<value>}

Replace the block type while trying to conserve the state. State is preserved only if the group of the output matches the input. This function acts on the [virtual block format](#get) stored in the block output.

  **Storage `bs:out block`**: {nbt}`compound` The `block`, `state` and `properties` are updated to reflect this change.
```

*Replace oak stairs with spruce stairs, preserving the current state:*

```mcfunction

data get storage bs:out block.block
```

::::
::::{tab-item} Map

`````{function} #bs.block:map_type {type:<value>,mapping_registry:<value>}

Swap related block types while ensuring coherent replacements within the defined mapping registry. A mapping registry is defined as follows:

```mcfunction
data modify storage bs:const block.mapping_registry.bs.colors set value [ \
  { set: "wool", attrs: ["red"], type: "minecraft:red_wool" }, \
  { set: "wool", attrs: ["green"], type: "minecraft:green_wool" }, \
  { set: "carpet", attrs: ["red"], type: "minecraft:red_carpet" }, \
  { set: "carpet", attrs: ["green"], type: "minecraft:green_carpet" }, \
]
```

This function operates on the [virtual block format](#get) stored in the block output. It replaces the type in the output with one that belongs to the same set and better matches the attributes of the inputted type.

For example, with the above mapping registry: if the input is `minecraft:red_wool` (attrs:["red"]), and the virtual block type is `minecraft:green_carpet` (set:"carpet"), the resulting block will be `minecraft:red_carpet` (set:"carpet",attrs:["red"]).

Bookshelf includes two predefined mapping registries (`bs.shapes` and `bs.colors`). If these are insufficient, you can [create your own](#custom-mapping-registry).

:Inputs:
  **Function macro**:
  :::{treeview}
  - {nbt}`compound` Arguments
    - {nbt}`string` **type**: String representation of the id (e.g., `minecraft:stone`).
    - {nbt}`string` **mapping_registry**: A path to the mapping registry used for the replacement (e.g., `bs.shapes`).
  :::

  **Storage `bs:out block`**: {nbt}`compound` There’s no need for manual specification; rather, employ the relevant functions, such as [`get_block`](#get).

:Outputs:
  **Return**: Whether a type was found and the replacement occurred.

  **Storage `bs:out block`**: {nbt}`compound` The `block`, `state` and `properties` are updated to reflect this change.
`````

*Replace all oak-related blocks with spruce ones (the function replaces the oak stairs block with a spruce stairs block):*

```mcfunction
# Once (on oak_stairs)
execute positioned ~ ~ ~ run function #bs.block:get_block

# Replace type data
function #bs.block:map_type { type: "minecraft:spruce_planks", mapping_registry: "bs.shapes" }

# See the result
data get storage bs:out block.block
```

::::
::::{tab-item} Mix

`````{function} #bs.block:mix_type {type:<value>,mapping_registry:<value>}

```{admonition} Experimental
:class: warning

This function may sometimes behave unpredictably due to the arbitrary nature of block relationship definitions. Additionally, while the provided registries aim to cover a wide range of blocks, they are handcrafted and therefore not exhaustive.
```

Mix block types while ensuring coherent replacements within the defined mapping registry. A mapping registry is defined as follows:

```mcfunction
data modify storage bs:const block.mapping_registry.bs.colors set value [ \
  { set: "cube", attrs: ["stone"], type: "minecraft:stone" }, \
  { set: "cube", attrs: ["brick"], type: "minecraft:bricks" }, \
  { set: "cube", attrs: ["stone", "brick"], type: "minecraft:stone_bricks" }, \
  { set: "stairs", attrs: ["stone"], type: "minecraft:stone_stairs" }, \
  { set: "stairs", attrs: ["brick"], type: "minecraft:brick_stairs" }, \
  { set: "stairs", attrs: ["stone","brick"], type: "minecraft:stone_brick_stairs" }, \
]
```

This function operates on the [virtual block format](#get) stored in the block output. It replaces the type in the output with one that belongs to the same set and better matches the attributes of both the output and input types while prioritizing the input type.

For example, with the above mapping registry: if the input is `minecraft:bricks` (attrs:["brick"]), and the virtual block type is `minecraft:stone_stairs` (set:"stairs",attrs:["stone"]), the resulting block will be `minecraft:stone_brick_stairs` (set:"stairs",attrs:["stone","brick"]).

Bookshelf includes two predefined mapping registries (`bs.shapes` and `bs.colors`). If these are insufficient, you can [create your own](#custom-mapping-registry).

:Inputs:
  **Function macro**:
  :::{treeview}
  - {nbt}`compound` Arguments
    - {nbt}`string` **type**: String representation of the id (e.g., `minecraft:stone`).
    - {nbt}`string` **mapping_registry**: A path to the mapping registry used for the replacement (e.g., `bs.shapes`).
  :::

  **Storage `bs:out block`**: {nbt}`compound` There’s no need for manual specification; rather, employ the relevant functions, such as [`get_block`](#get).

:Outputs:
  **Return**: Whether a type was found and the replacement occurred.

  **Storage `bs:out block`**: {nbt}`compound` The `block`, `state` and `properties` are updated to reflect this change.

    - {nbt}`string` **item**: Item string id associated to a block.

:Outputs:
  **Storage `bs:out block`**: {nbt}`compound` Equivalent to the [`#bs.block:get_type`](#get) function.
```

*Get block data for the stone item:*

function #bs.block:lookup_item {item:"minecraft:stone"}

## 🎓 Custom mapping registry

This module allows you to create a personalized mapping registry tailored to your specific needs.

---

To create a new registry, you need to define an array within the `bs:const block.mapping_registry` storage. Each new registry should be namespaced, and each element must include `set`, `attrs`, and `type`. Here’s how you can define a new mapping registry:

```mcfunction
data modify storage bs:const block.mapping_registry.<namespace>.<name> [
  { set: "cube", attrs: ["oak"], type: "minecraft:oak_planks" }, \
  { set: "cube", attrs: ["spruce"], type: "minecraft:spruce_planks" }, \
  \
  { set: "stairs", attrs: ["oak"], type: "minecraft:oak_stairs" }, \
  { set: "stairs", attrs: ["spruce"], type: "minecraft:spruce_stairs" }, \
  \
  { set: "slab", attrs: ["oak"], type: "minecraft:oak_slab" }, \
  { set: "slab", attrs: ["spruce"], type: "minecraft:spruce_slab" }, \
]
```
