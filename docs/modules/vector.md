### Get

::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} From orientation

**`bs.vector:get_from_orientation`**

    : The entities for which the vector will be computed

Outputs

:   (scores) `@s bs.vector.[x,y,z]`
    : The vector components

Example

:   Create, for each Creeper, a vector from their respective orientation

    ```
    # Once
    execute as @e[type=creeper] run function bs.vector:get_from_orientation
    ```

```{admonition} Dependencies
:class: dropdown

This function require the following modules to work properly:

### Get length

**`bs.vector:length`**

Compute the norm of the vector

Inputs

:   (execution) `as <entities>`

    (scores) `@s bs.vector.[x,y,z]`
    : The vector components

Outputs

Example

:   Compute the length of a vector you defined on yourself

    ```
    # Once
    scoreboard players set @s bs.vector.x 1000
    scoreboard players set @s bs.vector.y 2000
    scoreboard players set @s bs.vector.z 3000

    execute as @s run function bs.vector:lenght

    # Display the result
    tellraw @a [{"text":"<"},{"selector":"@s"},{"text":">"},{"text":" Vector length: ","color":"dark_gray"},{"score":{"name":"@s","objective":"bs.out.0"}}]
    ```

```{admonition} Performance tip
:class: tip

If you want to minimize the performance impact, we recomande you to use the `lenght_squared` function instead of this one when it's possible. In fact, computing the lenght of a vector require to perform square root operation which is not a simple task for a computer, especially in Minecraft.

`lenght_squared` can often be used in the following cases:
- You want to compare the length with a given one, then compute manually the square of the given value and compare it with the result of `lenght_squared`, which is faster than computing the real length.
- You want to compare a vector length with another one, then you can compare the result of `lenght_squared` instead of computing the real length of both vectors.
```

```{admonition} Dependencies

This function require the following modules to work properly:
- [`bs.math`](math)
```
:::
:::{tab-item} Length squared

**`bs.vector:lenght_squared`**

Compute the norm of the squared vector and store it on the score `bs.out.0`.

Inputs

:   (execution) `as <entities>`
    : The entities for which the vector will be computed

    (scores) `@s bs.vector.[x,y,z]`
    : The vector components

Outputs

:   (score) `@s bs.out.0`
    : The vector length squared

Example

:   Compute the length squared of a vector you defined on yourself

    ```
    # Once
    scoreboard players set @s bs.vector.x 1000
    scoreboard players set @s bs.vector.y 2000
    scoreboard players set @s bs.vector.z 3000

    execute as @s run function bs.vector:lenght_squared

    # Display the result
    tellraw @a [{"text":"<"},{"selector":"@s"},{"text":">"},{"text":" Vector length squared: ","color":"dark_gray"},{"score":{"name":"@s","objective":"bs.out.0"}}]
    ```

### Normalize

::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} Classic

**`bs.vector:normalize`**

Allows to normalize the components of the vector by putting the length at 1000 (=1 but shited by 3 digits) while respecting the proportions linking these components.

Inputs

:   (execution) `as <entities>`
    : The entities for which the vector will be normalized

    (scores) `@s bs.vector.[x,y,z]`
    : The initial vector ($V_i$) components

    ```{admonition} Config
    :class: dropdown

    You can configure the length of normalization (which is 1000 by default) by setting the score `vector.normalize.length bs.data` score to the desired value and giving the tag `bs.config.override` to the entity executing the function. Be careful, without this tag, the config score will be reseted to the default value.
    ```

Option

:   (score) `@s bs.opt.0` (default: 1000)
    : The length of the normalized vector shifted by 3 digits

Outputs

:   (scores) `@s bs.vector.[x,y,z]`
    : The normalized vector ($V_n$) components

    (score) `@s bs.out.0`
    : The normalisation factor $A$ ($V_i = A \times V_n$) shifted by 3 digits

```{admonition} Performance tip
:class: tip

Normalization of vector doesn't often need to be accurate, so you can try first to use the `fast_normalize` function instead of this one. It is less accurate, but it avoid the square root computation so it is faster.
```

```{admonition} Dependencies
:class: dropdown

This function require the following modules to work properly:
- [`bs.math`](math)
```

:::
:::{tab-item} Fast

**`bs.vector:fast_normalize`**

Allows to normalize the components of the vector by placing the largest component at 1000 (=1 but shited by 3 digits) while respecting the proportions linking these components.

    (scores) `@s bs.vector.[x,y,z]`
    : The vector components

Option

:   (score) `@s bs.opt.0` (default: 1000)
    : The length of the normalized vector shifted by 3 digits

Outputs

:   (scores) `@s bs.vector.[x,y,z]`
    : The normalized vector components

    (score) `@s bs.out.0`
    : The normalisation factor $A$ ($V_i = A \times V_n$) shifted by 3 digits

    scoreboard players set @s bs.vector.z 0
    function bs.vector:get_from_classic_vector
