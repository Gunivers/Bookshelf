## üîß Functions

You can find below all functions available in this module.

---

### Canonical to local

```{function} #bs.move:canonical_to_local

Convert a canonical velocity (using the relative reference frame) into a local velocity (using the local reference frame).

:Inputs:
  **Execution `rotated as <entity>` or `rotated <h> <v>`**: Rotation used for the conversion.

  **Scores `@s bs.vel.[x,y,z]`**: Velocity to convert.

:Outputs:
  **Scores `@s bs.vel.[x,y,z]`**: Converted velocity.
```

```{admonition} Local velocity... ü•∂ What's this?
:class: dropdown

Unlike relative velocity (canonical), this reference frame considers the entity's rotation. Therefore, when the parent entity rotates, the child entity rotates around it. For those familiar with Minecraft commands, local coordinates are available through the `^` symbol.
```

Although this system doesn't set specific limits, it's important to note that performance is influenced by both the speed and size of the entity.

## üéì Custom collisions

This module allows you to customize collision behaviors according to your specific needs.

---

By modifying the `on_collision` input key, you have the freedom to specify the function that triggers upon collision. However, managing the resolution yourself can be quite challenging. This is why Bookshelf provides several predefined functions:

:::{list-table}
  *   - `#bs.move:on_collision/bounce`
      - The entity will bounce on the collision surface.
  *   - `#bs.move:on_collision/damped_bounce`
      - The entity speed is reduced by 2 on each bounce.
  *   - `#bs.move:on_collision/slide`
      - The entity will stick and slide along the collision surface.
  *   - `#bs.move:on_collision/stick`
      - The entity will stop and stick to the collision surface.
:::

### How it works?

Upon collision, you have the freedom to update both the velocity score that will be used in the next tick `@s bs.vel.[x,y,z]` and the remaining velocity `$move.vel_remaining.[x,y,z] bs.data`, which is always scaled by 1000. Since the module will attempt to continue moving based on the remaining velocity, it's crucial to avoid introducing a race condition.

The simplest collision resolution is to stop the movement.

*`#bs.move:on_collision/stick`*
```mcfunction
# set all components to 0 to cancel the movement
execute store result score $move.vel_remaining.x bs.data run scoreboard players set @s bs.vel.x 0
execute store result score $move.vel_remaining.y bs.data run scoreboard players set @s bs.vel.y 0
execute store result score $move.vel_remaining.z bs.data run scoreboard players set @s bs.vel.z 0
```

For sliding, we need to cancel the velocity on the axis that was hit and continue traveling the remaining distance.

*`#bs.move:on_collision/slide`*
```mcfunction
# set a component to 0 depending on the surface that was hit
execute if score $move.hit_face bs.data matches 4..5 store result score $move.vel_remaining.x bs.data run scoreboard players set @s bs.vel.x 0
execute if score $move.hit_face bs.data matches 0..1 store result score $move.vel_remaining.y bs.data run scoreboard players set @s bs.vel.y 0
execute if score $move.hit_face bs.data matches 2..3 store result score $move.vel_remaining.z bs.data run scoreboard players set @s bs.vel.z 0
```

To simplify the creation of these behaviors, there's no need to handle a local velocity directly. The vector is automatically converted before and after the collision resolution. If you need help with custom collisions, you can ask us on our [discord server](https://discord.gg/E8qq6tN)!
