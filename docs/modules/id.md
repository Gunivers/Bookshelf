# üè∑Ô∏è ID

**`#bs.id:help`**

The management of entity IDs allows to identify precisely
an entity. Useful for example in the case of a shooting game to know who
is shooting at whom.

## üîß Functions

You can find below all the function available in this module.

---

### Give simple unique ID

**`#bs.id:give_suid`**

(Simple Unique ID) Allows the entity executing the function to get a `bs.id` score different from all other entities that have already executed the function.

Input

:   (execution) `as <entities>`
    : The entities you want to assign an ID to.

Outputs

:   (score) `@s bs.id`
    : The ID of the executing entity.

Example

:   Give an ID to all players:

    ```mcfunction
    # Give an id to all players who don‚Äôt have one
    execute as @a unless score @s bs.id matches 1.. run function #bs.id:give_suid

    # See the result
    scoreboard objective setdisplay sidebar bs.id
    ```

### Give chain unique ID

**`#bs.id:give_cuid`**

(Chain Unique ID) Allows the entity running the function to get a score `bs.cid` different from all other entities that have already run the function. The difference with `get_suid` is in the way the scores are assigned:

* ID scores are assigned dynamically based on the available scores.
* If there are 5 entities, they will be numbered from 1 to 5, without any "hole".
* In order not to break this chain, you must also execute the `update_cuids` function.

Input

:   (execution) `as <entities>`
    : The entities you want to assign an ID to.

Outputs

:   (score) `@s bs.cid`
    : The ID of the executing entity.

Example

:   Give an ID to all players:

    ```mcfunction
    # Give an id to all players who don‚Äôt have one
    execute as @a unless score @s bs.cid matches 1.. run function #bs.id:give_cuid

    # See the result
    scoreboard objective setdisplay sidebar bs.cid
    ```

### Update chain unique ID

**`#bs.id:update_cuids`**

Allows to update all entities CUIDs.

Example

:   Keep the ID string free of holes and duplicates:

    ```mcfunction
    function #bs.id:update_cuids

    # See the result
    scoreboard objective setdisplay sidebar bs.cid
    ```

## üëÅÔ∏è Predicates

You can find below all predicates available in this module.

---

### Check simple unique ID

::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} Match

**`bs.id:suid_match`**

Find an entity that has the same ``bs.id`` as the input value.

Input

:   (score) `$id.suid.check bs.in`: int
    : The value to check against.

Example

:   Find the entity with a ``bs.id`` equal to 1:

    ```mcfunction
    scoreboard players set $id.suid.check bs.in 1

    execute as @e[predicate=bs.id:suid_match,limit=1] run say I'm the one
    ```

:::
:::{tab-item} Lower

**`bs.id:suid_lower`**

Filter entities that have a ``bs.id`` less than or equal to the input value.

Input

:   (score) `$id.suid.check bs.in`: int
    : The value to check against.

Example

:   Filter entities that have a ``bs.id`` less than or equal to 17:

    ```mcfunction
    scoreboard players set $id.suid.check bs.in 17

    execute as @e[predicate=bs.id:suid_lower] run say I'm a minor
    ```

:::
:::{tab-item} Upper

**`bs.id:suid_upper`**

Filter entities that have a ``bs.id`` greater than or equal to the input value.

Input

:   (score) `$id.suid.check bs.in`: int
    : The value to check against.

Example

:   Filter entities that have a ``bs.id`` greater than or equal to 18:

    ```mcfunction
    scoreboard players set $id.suid.check bs.in 18

    execute as @e[predicate=bs.id:suid_upper] run say I'm an adult
    ```

### Check chain unique ID

::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} Match

**`bs.id:cuid_match`**

Find an entity that has the same ``bs.cid`` as the input value.

Input

:   (score) `$id.cuid.check bs.in`: int
    : The value to check against.

Example

:   Find the entity with a ``bs.cid`` equal to 1:

    ```mcfunction
    scoreboard players set $id.cuid.check bs.in 1

    execute as @e[predicate=bs.id:cuid_match,limit=1] run say I'm the one
    ```

:::
:::{tab-item} Lower

**`bs.id:cuid_lower`**

Filter entities that have a ``bs.cid`` less than or equal to the input value.

Input

:   (score) `$id.cuid.check bs.in`: int
    : The value to check against.

Example

:   Filter entities that have a ``bs.cid`` less than or equal to 17:

    ```mcfunction
    scoreboard players set $id.cuid.check bs.in 17

    execute as @e[predicate=bs.id:cuid_lower] run say I'm a minor
    ```

:::
:::{tab-item} Upper

**`bs.id:cuid_upper`**

Filter entities that have a ``bs.cid`` greater than or equal to the input value.

Input

:   (score) `$id.cuid.check bs.in`: int
    : The value to check against.

Example

:   Filter entities that have a ``bs.cid`` greater than or equal to 18:

    ```mcfunction
    scoreboard players set $id.cuid.check bs.in 18

    execute as @e[predicate=bs.id:cuid_upper] run say I'm an adult
    ```
