# üñ±Ô∏è Interaction

**`#bs.interaction:help`**

Create and manage Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) in Minecraft.

```{epigraph}
"As far as the customer is concerned, the interface is the product."

-- Jef Raskin
```

The Interaction API is a low-level API to create GUIs based on the [Interaction](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Interaction) entity.
This API is low level since the possible events are directly and manually bind to the interaction.

## üîß Functions

You can find below all functions available in this API.

### Clear events

```{function} #bs.interaction:clear_events

Clear events registered for the specified interaction entity.

:Inputs:
  **Execution `as <entity>`**: Interaction entity for which the events will be cleared.

  **Function Macro**:
  :::{treeview}
  - {nbt}`compound` **Arguments**:
    - {nbt}`compound` **with**: Parameters to filter which events to clear. Clear all events if empty.
      - {nbt}`string` **type**: Specify the type of events to clear.
      - {nbt}`int` **id**: Specify the ID of events to clear.
  :::

:Outputs:
  **Return**: The number of events removed.

  **State**: The specified events for the interaction entity will be removed.
```

*Clear hover events for the interaction entity:*

```mcfunction
summon minecraft:interaction ~ ~ ~ { Tags: ["bs.entity.interaction"], width: 1f, height: 1f }

# Register hover events for the interaction
execute as @n[tag=bs.entity.interaction] run function #bs.interaction:on_hover { run: "say Hovered", executor: "target" }

# Clear hover events for the interaction
execute as @n[tag=bs.entity.interaction] run function #bs.interaction:clear_events { with: { type: "hover" } }
```

### On event

:::::{tab-set}
::::{tab-item} Left click

```{function} #bs.interaction:on_left_click

Register a command to run when the left click is pressed on the current interaction.
Each interaction can respond to multiple events.

:Inputs:
  **Execution `as <entity>`**: Interaction entity for which the event is registered.

  **Function macro**:
  :::{treeview}
  - {nbt}`compound` Arguments
    - {nbt}`string` **run**: Command to execute upon left-click.
    - {nbt}`string` {nbt}`compound` **executor**: Defines the entity on which the command will be executed. Can be either **"source"** for the player who performed the action or **"target"** for the interaction entity itself. A compound can also be used to target other entities:
      - {nbt}`string` **selector**: Specifies entities for the command execution (`execute as <entity>`).
      - {nbt}`bool` **lazy**: Determines whether to resolve the selector immediately (`false`) or at runtime (`true`, default). If `false`, the selector must target only one entity, replacing the selector with that entity‚Äôs UUID. Useful for optimizing execution, especially when targeting graphical representations. If multiple entities are targeted, the first one is selected.
  :::

:Outputs:
  **Return**: The ID of the created event.

  **State**: The interaction will trigger the event when left clicked.
```
::::
::::{tab-item} Right click

```{function} #bs.interaction:on_right_click

Register a command to run when the right click is pressed on the current interaction.
Each interaction can respond to multiple events.

:Inputs:
  **Execution `as <entity>`**: Interaction entity for which the event is registered.

  **Function Macro**:
  :::{treeview}
  - {nbt}`compound` **Arguments**:
    - {nbt}`string` **run**: Command to execute upon right-click.
    - {nbt}`string` {nbt}`compound` **executor**: Defines the entity on which the command will be executed. Can be either **"source"** for the player who performed the action or **"target"** for the interaction entity itself. A compound can also be used to target other entities:
      - {nbt}`string` **selector**: Specifies entities for the command execution (`execute as <entity>`).
      - {nbt}`bool` **lazy**: Determines whether to resolve the selector immediately (`false`) or at runtime (`true`, default). If `false`, the selector must target only one entity, replacing the selector with that entity‚Äôs UUID. Useful for optimizing execution, especially when targeting graphical representations. If multiple entities are targeted, the first one is selected.
  :::

:Outputs:
  **Return**: The ID of the created event.

  **State**: The interaction will trigger the event when right clicked.
```
::::
::::{tab-item} Hover

```{function} #bs.interaction:on_hover

Register a command to run continuously while the player is hovering over the interaction.
Each interaction can respond to multiple events.

:Inputs:
  **Execution `as <entity>`**: Interaction entity for which the event is registered.

  **Function Macro**:
  :::{treeview}
  - {nbt}`compound` **Arguments**:
    - {nbt}`string` **run**: Command to execute while hovering over the interaction.
    - {nbt}`string` {nbt}`compound` **executor**: Defines the entity on which the command will be executed. Can be either **"source"** for the player who performed the action or **"target"** for the interaction entity itself. A compound can also be used to target other entities:
      - {nbt}`string` **selector**: Specifies entities for the command execution (`execute as <entity>`).
      - {nbt}`bool` **lazy**: Determines whether to resolve the selector immediately (`false`) or at runtime (`true`, default).

Register a command to run once when the player begins hovering over the interaction.
Each interaction can respond to multiple events.

:Inputs:

  - {nbt}`compound` **Arguments**:
    - {nbt}`string` **run**: Command to execute when hovering begins.
    - {nbt}`string` {nbt}`compound` **executor**: Defines the entity on which the command will be executed. Can be either **"source"** for the player who performed the action or **"target"** for the interaction entity itself. A compound can also be used to target other entities:

```


```{admonition} Edge case
:class: warning

If a player logs out while hovering over the interaction, the hover leave event will trigger on the executor. If the executor is the player, the event won‚Äôt be triggered again when they log back in. Be sure to account for this edge case and handle it appropriately when the player returns.
```

# Callback to glow the icon when the interaction is hovered
