### Basis rotation 3D

**`bs.math:basis_rotation_3d`**

   ```{admonition} Basis system
   :class: info

   This system use the Minecraft coordinate system. Thus:
   - $\hat{y}$ is the vertical axis.
   - $\phi=0$ (starting point of the horizontal angle) is along the $\hat{z}$ axis.

   scoreboard players set @s bs.in.1 5000
   scoreboard players set @s bs.in.2 10000

   # Difference between my orientation (= that of the coondata grid ^X ^Y ^Z) and the orientation of the Minecraft blocks grid (~X ~Y ~Z)
   function bs.orientation:get
   scoreboard players operation @s bs.in.3 = @s bs.ori.h
   scoreboard players operation @s bs.in.4 = @s bs.ori.v

   ```

   I want to have a vector pointing to where I'm looking, but in relative coordinates ~X ~Y ~Z (also called "classical" vector in this library)
   
   ```
   # Once

   # Retrieve a vector ^ ^ ^1 corresponding to a vector directed according to the orientation of the entity (we multiply by 1000 to have more precision on the result, which will also be multiplied by 1000)
   scoreboard players set @s bs.in.0 0
   scoreboard players set @s bs.in.1 0
   scoreboard players set @s bs.in.2 1000

   # Get the orientation
   function bs.orientation:get

   ```

```{admonition} How does it work?
:class: dropdown

This function use the Bhaskara approximation which tell us that

$$
\sin(x) \approx \frac{4x(180-x)}{40500-x(180-x)} \quad \forall x \in [0, 180]
$$

From this relation, and using the properties
- $\sin(-x) = -\sin(x)$ (antisymetry)
- $\sin(x+360) = \sin(x)$ (periodicity)

We can compute the sine of any angle.
