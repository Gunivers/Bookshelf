The development of Bookshelf is collaborative, which means that other people can read the code. Moreover, Bookshelf is also meant to be pedagogical and accessible to people curious about the way the functions of Bookshelf work. Therefore, it is important to make it understood by other developers or users, and this, in addition to the documentation, also goes through the commentary of the code. Thus, it is important to regularly and cleanly comment on functions in order to explain how the function works.
