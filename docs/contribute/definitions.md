# ðŸ“– Definitions

In order to speak with the same vocabulary, here is some words that have a specific meaning in this project:

- **Module**: a group of features that share a common purpose and that are contained in a namespace (i.e. datapack structures)
- **Feature**: something designed for the final user in order to allow him to perform a task. Most of the time, a feature is a function tag to call instead of the function. This enable, among other things, filtering the `/function` completion by proposing only the features. A feature can also be a loot_table, a structure, a predicate or whatever.
- **Brigadier**: This is the command completer and highlighter of Minecraft that you can see when you enter a command in the chat. We define it here because most of people doesn't know that this system have a name.
- **Data pack developer**: A person who develops a datapack (using Bookshelf or not).
- **Bookshelf contributor**: A person contributing to the development of Bookshelf, through pull request for instance.
