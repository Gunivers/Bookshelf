# ðŸ“– Definitions

In order to speak with the same vocabulary, here is some words that have a specific meaning in this project:

- **Module**: a group of features that share a common purpose and that are contained in a namespace (i.e. datapack structures)
- **Feature**: something designed for the final user in order to allow him to perform a task. A feature can be a function, a loot_table, a structure, a predicate or whatever.
- **Brigadier**: This is the command completer and highlighter of Minecraft that you can see when you enter a command in the chat. We define it here because most of people doesn't know that this system have a name.
