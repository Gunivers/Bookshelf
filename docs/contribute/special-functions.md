# ðŸŒŸ Special functions

##  ðŸ‘‰ The "ata" functions

This is a reduction of "as to at". Several functions require 2 positions to work (example: retrieve the distance between 2 points) or an entity and a position. To simplify the use, no need to pass 3 scores for each position. You will be able to place an entity on point 1 (if it is useful), then execute the function on point 2 by executing it on the entity on point 1.

## ðŸ”’ The "reserved" functions

Reserved functions are special functions within each module that serve predefined purposes. They must all have a function tag (without "__") and are located at the root of each module.

:::{list-table}
