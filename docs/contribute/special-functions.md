# ðŸŒŸ Special Functions

Some functions follow specific conventions to streamline functionality and ensure consistency across modules.

---

##  ðŸ‘‰ The "ata" Functions

This is a reduction of "as to at". Several functions require 2 positions to work (example: retrieve the distance between 2 points) or an entity and a position. To simplify the use, no need to pass 3 scores for each position. You will be able to place an entity on point 1 (if it is useful), then execute the function at point 2 while executing it as the entity on point 1.

## ðŸ”’ The "reserved" Functions

Reserved functions are special functions within each module that serve predefined purposes. They are located at the root of each module.
