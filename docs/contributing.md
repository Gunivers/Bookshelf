# 🤝 Contribute

Bookshelf is a community project and can therefore be developed by several people at the same time. To keep the project clean and consistent, it is necessary for the different developers to respect some conventions when developing functions. In the following page, you can find all the Bookshelf standards. This standard is signed by the prefix "**`bs.`**" in the namespaces so you can identify all the datapacks that use it.

To contribute on this project, you must

- Know the structure of a minecraft datapack (5-10 min to learn on internet)
- Know the basic usage of git projects (20-30 min to learn on internet)
- Be accessible to answer questions about your work

:class: note
Ce projet est réalisé principalement par des membres francophones mais à destination d'un public international. C'est pourquoi toute la lib ainsi que la documentation est en anglais.

Si vous souhaitez contribuer mais que votre anglais n'est pas au point, vous pouvez utiliser des outils comme [DeepL](https://DeepL.com) puis demander une vérification.

### 📖 Definitions

In order to speak with the same vocabulary, here is some words that have a specific meaning in this project:

- **Module**: a group of features that share a common purpose and that are contained in a namespace (i.e. datapack structures)
- **Feature**: something designed for the final user in order to allow him to perform a task. A feature can be a function, a loot_table, a structure, a predicate or whatever.
- **MVP**: for "Minimum Viable Product" correspond to a feature that can not be decomposed in several smaller features. In this lib, all features should be decomposed in MVP, and use theses MVP instead of redefining them.
- **Brigadier**: This is the command completer and highlighter of Minecraft that you can see when you enter a command in the chat. We define it here because most of people doesn't know that this system have a name.

---
### 🏷️Nomenclature

Bookshelf respects a certain tree structure which can be similar to the Java packages, called "modules" in this project. The added features must therefore be positioned in these various folders (corresponding to a namespaces) according to their usefulness. If no namespace folder (i.e. module) seems appropriate for the addition of a feature, it can be considered to add a new namespace. A category must respect a particular structure:

-  File and folders use the snake_case convention. Example: `my_function`
-  Score objectives use the camelCase convention with the `bs.` prefix. Example: `bs.myScore`
-  Fake players use the SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE convention. Exemple: `MY_FAKE_PLAYER`. Add `#` before the name to hide the fake player in the scoreboard when there is no point to let it visible.
-  Tags use the UpperCamelCase convention with the `bs.` prefix. Example: `bs.MyTag`
-  A feature is equal to an unique utility, so we should not hesitate to decompose its features in MVP in order to make it more readable and to promote the reusability of the MVP. In addition to these few constraints, the contributor is free to organize his files as he wishes as long as it remains coherent and understandable, and it respect the global structure detailed below.
-  In some folders are files nammed "`_`". The main purpose of these files is to reorganize the display of Bookshelf folders during the auto-completion proposed by Brigadier. Thus, the first proposals are not all the files of a particular folder but the folder itself, followed only by "`_`" (wich can be easily removed to allow to press 'tab' again and continue to explore the tree structure). These files can be added in all folders, and if possible, they may describe and/or represent, the category in question or a redirection to the section of the documentation related to the category.

### 🌳 Tree structure

The lib must respect this global structure:

```
📁data
├─ 📁 <module1>
│  └─ 📁 functions/predicates/loot_tables/...
│     ├─ 📁 <feature1>
│     ├─ 📁 <feature2>
│     ├─ 📄 <feature1>
│     └─ 📄 <feature2>
├─ 📁 <module2>
│  └─ ...
└─ ...
```

:::{note}
   Functions, predicates, structures, loot tables etc. must respect the same structure.
:::

In this structure, you can find a "feature" file and it's associated folder. This "feature" représent a "minimal viable product" (something that have a specific utility but that can require to be a part of another system in order to work)

Features files must respect this structure:

```
📄 <featureName>
📁 <featureName>
    ├─ 📁 accuracy
    │  │  # Same function, but with another precision, ex:
    │  ├─ 📄 10-3.mcfunction
    │  └─ 📄 ...
    ├─ 📁 child
    │  │  # sub-functions, not destined to be executed by the user, ex:
    │  ├─ 📄 loop.mcfunction
    │  └─ 📄 ...
    ├─ 📁 config
    │  │  # mcfunction editable by the user to allwo him to customize the function behavior, ex:
    │  ├─ 📄 entity_concerned.mcfunction
    │  └─ 📄 ...
    └─ 📁 debug
        │  # tools dedicated to debug a system, ex:
        ├─ 📄 print.mcfunction
        └─ 📄 ...
```

:::{note}
   The main file is the only file that is required. Other files/folders depends on the needs of the feature.
:::

| Folder | Description |
|:------:|:-----------:|
| Accuracy | They allow to manage the precision of the functions.<br> Minecraft allowing to store only integers, to use decimals, you have to be clever.<br> Thus, a function in "accuracy/10-3" will be a function which will see its parameters<br> (at least most of them), multiplied by 1000 to be able to store 3 digits after the<br> decimal point (3.14159 * 10^3 = 3141.59, which gives 3141 once in a score).<br> Not all functions have an equivalent in the above specifications.<br> If you need a function with a precision that is not supported, contact us on our<br> Discord, a dev will do that quickly ;) |
| Child    | Child folder contain every function used by other functions to make them works.<br> These functions are not supposed to be executed or edited by the user. |
| Config   | The lib has several systems that manage different behavior (e.g. pathfinding,<br> a bat will not have the same behavior as a villager).<br> You will then find a "main" file that will list the different files and<br> call the right one according to a certain condition.<br> This allows the user of the lib to create his own<br> behavior by copying an existing behavior file, adapting it,<br> and linking it to the system via the "main" file. |
| Debug    | The "debug" folders contain functions that are intended to display<br> a certain number of parameters specific to the folder<br> in which they are located<br> (e.g. debug in the vector folder will display the different vectors).<br> These functions are usually called by other functions but can also be executed<br> by the user in order to debug one of his systems at a specific location. |

### 📄 File format

All the functions of Bookshelf implement documentation to
describe for other developers as well as for users what the function is
for and how to use it. This is what this one looks like:

```
# INFO ------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Copyright © 2023 Gunivers Community.

# Authors       :
# Contributors  : 

# Version: (system version)
# Created: jj/mm/yyyy (minecraft version)
# Last verification: jj/mm/yyyy (minecraft version)
# Last modification: jj/mm/yyyy (minecraft version)

# Original path : bs.path:to/function
# Documentation : https://link.to/documentation/page
# Note          :

# INIT ------------------------------------------------------------------------

# CONFIG ----------------------------------------------------------------------

# CODE ------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

We can find various information about the function itself (the example is not exhaustive), of which the following is a complete list:

| Field | Description |
|:-----:|:-----------:|
| Authors | The list of authors of the function. |
| Contributors | The list of contributors to the function.<br> A contributor is someone who helps to create the function<br> without developing it (the one who gives a track to realize the function<br> or the one who fixes a bug for example). |
| MC Version | Version of Minecraft for which the system was created. |
| Last check | Version of Minecraft until which the system is certified functional. |
| Original path | The path to the function so that it can be copied to a /function command. |
| Documentation | Link to the documentation of the function |
| Note | Allows you to provide additional information about the function<br> such as a description of what the function does, how to use it if the use<br> is particular, the behaviors of the function or the side effects of its use. |

### 🎖️ Special scores

This lib use global scores, that are automatically created:

| Scores name | Description |
|:------:|:-----------:|
| `bs` | Dedicated to temporary storage (ex: fake players) |
| `bs.config` | Allow to define the behavior of some systems |
| `bs.const` | Contain a huge numer of fakeplayers with constant score value |
| `bs.data` | Uses by the `bs.core` module.<br> Do not use it without knowing exactly what you are doing. |
| `bs.debug` | Determine the behavior of debug features |
| `bs.debug.id` | A built-in ID palced on every entities for debug purposes |
| `bs.lifetime`| If positive (default behavior), count the number of tick the entity exist. If negative, determine the number of ticks the entity will live (killed when the score reach -1). This socre is automatically incremented each tick. |
| `bs.res[0-9]` | Default score for outputs |
| `bs.var[0-9]` | Default score for inputs |

### ♻️ Conservation principle

```{epigraph}
"Nothing is lost, nothing is created, everything is transformed"

-- Antoine Lavoisier
```

The lib must have a minimum impact on the scores and other data in order to avoid some overwritings of data. It means that we should avoid as much as possible to : 

- Create new scores
- Delete scores (totally forbidden)
- Avoid unnecessary scores rewriting

To do so, each input - as well as other data used by the fonction - must be saved in the begining of the function (in a fake player for example) and restored at the end. Only the outputs of the functions should change.

:::{note}
This is a new directive, so most of the functions doesn't respect it for now. Please do not hesistate to update the existing functions in order to apply this directive.
:::

Also for scores, by default, the input and outputs should use respectively the scores `bs.var[0-9]` and `bs.res[0-9]`. But they can use others scores when it's is more appropriate, for exemple to allow writing chains of calling functions like :

```
# Multiply the X coordinate of the source entity and place the entity at the new location
function bs.location:get
scoreboard players operation @s bs.locX *= 2 bs.const
function bs.location:set
```
In this exemple, the `get` function will return `bs.loc[X,Y,Z]` scores, that are also used as input for the `set` function.

## 🤯 Advanced stuff

If you want to deeply take a part of the project, here is more advanced stuff for you!

Welcome in the dark side! 😈

---
### ⚙️ Initialization

In order to make use as easy as possible, each function must limit its dependencies as much as possible. It must then declare each of the variables it uses in the "INIT" part. It is not necessary to initialize variables used by child functions because child functions are supposed to initialize them. On the other hand, it is forbidden to neglect a declaration for any other reason (example: "Var1 is already used everywhere").

All the special scores doesn't need to be declared, they are automatically created by the lib. Also, in order to simplify arithmetical operations, the lib define plenty of constants stored on the score `bs.const`. You can find them in `bs.core/functions/import/constants.mcfunction`. All constants used in the lib must be defined in this file.

---
### 🔧 Configuration

Some functions require parameters that are usually fixed. However, the function can manage other parameters and the user, in a particular case, may need to change this parameter. So we call them configuration parameters, which are parameters with a default value. These values are initialized in the "CONFIG" part.

As you can see in several files, some lines in the configuration part call the "bs.config.override" tag. It allows you not to rewrite the score values (or other) if they have been voluntarily set to another value. So, if you want to use something else than the default value for a function, add the "bs.config.override" tag before executing the function, then remove this tag immediately afterwards.

---
### 💭 Comments

The development of Bookshelf is collaborative, which means that other people can read the code. Moreover, Bookshelf is also meant to be pedagogical and accessible to people curious about the way the functions of Bookshelf work. Therefore, it is important to make it understood by other developers or users, and this, in addition to the
documentation, also goes through the commentary of the code. Thus, it is important to regularly and cleanly comment on functions in order to explain how the function works.

---
### 🪲 Debug

It is possible to add debug lines anywhere in the code. However, these must be subject to conditions. For the debug to be displayed to a player, that player must have the tag `bs.debug.<PATH>` where `<PATH>` is the path to the function. In the tags, this path is written ith `.` as separators. Example: `bs.vector:classic/get_ata` => `bs.debug.vector.classic.get_ata`

There is 3 different types of debug messages:
- Error: which display every critical situation
- Warning: for errors that can be managed by the libs
- Record: to let the user know what happen during the execution of the system

Every debug message must be visually opened using the following tellraws:

- **Error without source entity**
   ```
   tellraw @a[tag=bs.debug.<PATH>] [{"text":" > ","bold":true,"color":"gold"},{"text":"Glib","color":"dark_aqua"},{"text":" | ","color":"gold"},{"text":"ERROR in <PATH>","color":"red","clickEvent":{"action":"open_url","value":"tag @s remove bs.debug.<PATH>"},"hoverEvent":{"action":"show_text","contents":"Hide this debug"}}]
   ```

- **Warning without source entity**
   ```
   tellraw @a[tag=bs.debug.<PATH>] [{"text":" > ","bold":true,"color":"gold"},{"text":"Glib","color":"dark_aqua"},{"text":" | ","color":"gold"},{"text":"WARNING in <PATH>","color":"yellow","clickEvent":{"action":"open_url","value":"tag @s remove bs.debug.<PATH>"},"hoverEvent":{"action":"show_text","contents":"Hide this debug"}}]
   ```

- **Record without source entity**
   ```
   tellraw @a[tag=bs.debug.<PATH>] [{"text":" > ","bold":true,"color":"gold"},{"text":"Glib","color":"dark_aqua"},{"text":" | ","color":"gold"},{"text":"Record from <PATH>","color":"green","clickEvent":{"action":"open_url","value":"tag @s remove bs.debug.<PATH>"},"hoverEvent":{"action":"show_text","contents":"Hide this debug"}}]
   ```

Also, all debugs must end with

```
tellraw @a[tag=bs.debug.<PATH>] ["",{"text":" <","bold":true,"color":"gold"}]
```

⚠️ All debugs must be preceded by ``# Start Debug`` and followed by ``# End Debug`` in order to be automatically commented by a program.

### 🌟 Special functions

#### 👉 The "ata" functions

This is a reduction of "as to at". Several functions require 2 positions to work (example: retrieve the distance between 2 points) or an entity and a position. To simplify the use, no need to pass 3 scores for each position. You will be able to place an entity on point 1 (if it is useful), then execute the function on point 2 by executing it on the entity on point 1.

#### 🆔 The "tti" functions

This is a reduction of "to target id". Several functions require 2 a source and a target entity (example: get a vector to another entity). To simplify the use, no need to always use the `id/check` function.
