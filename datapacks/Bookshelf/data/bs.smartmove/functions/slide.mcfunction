# EXPLAINATIONS ---------------------------------------------------------------

### Why using these two scores?
#   The best way in Minecraft to detect that the player is sprinting or crouching is to use custom objectives.
#   One is made to count the time during which the player is crouching (it is actualized automatically by the game).
#   The other is made to measure the distance traveled by the player during a sprint (also actualized automatically by the game).
#   The idea is then to detect if these scores are not 0, which means that the player is crouching or sprinting.
#   Then, the system reset these score to 0 in order to avoid false positive on the next tick.

### Why using an armor_stand?
#   When a player is teleported, he's position is actualised in the same tick so there is no teleportation animation.
#   However, other entities' position are actualised in the next tick, so there is a teleportation animation.
#   A funny thing is that when a player is riding an entity, the player's position is actualised in the next tick too.
#   He will then also have the animation, so the movement will be much more fluid.
#   The choice of armor_stand comes from the need of a light and small entity which exist on the client side.
#   In fact, markers would be perfect for this job... but they exist only on server side, so the player can't ride them.
