# Note:
# - This function returns the exclusive or bitwise between two numbers.
# - Example: -178 ^ 32165 = -32021
# - Formula: a ^ b = (a + b) - 2*(a & b)
# The result is the number composed by putting one at all bits where the value in the two binary representations of these numbers is different.
