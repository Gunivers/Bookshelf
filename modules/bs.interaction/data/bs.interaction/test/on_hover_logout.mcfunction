execute as @n[type=minecraft:interaction,tag=bs.packtest,distance=..2] run function #bs.interaction:on_hover_enter { run: "scoreboard players add #packtest.interaction_hover_count bs.data 1", executor: "target" }
execute as @n[type=minecraft:interaction,tag=bs.packtest,distance=..2] run function #bs.interaction:on_hover_leave { run: "scoreboard players remove #packtest.interaction_hover_count bs.data 1", executor: "target" }
scoreboard players set #packtest.interaction_hover_count bs.data 0
